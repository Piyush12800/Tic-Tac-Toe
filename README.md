# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic Tac Toe is a classic game that has been enjoyed by people of all ages for decades. This web-based Tic Tac Toe project showcases the implementation of the game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The project offers an interactive and visually appealing user interface that engages players in the familiar game of Tic Tac Toe. The game board is represented by a 3x3 grid, constructed using HTML elements and styled using CSS to provide a modern and intuitive design.

The gameplay is facilitated by JavaScript, which handles the logic and functionality behind the scenes. Players can take turns by clicking on the individual grid cells, which triggers event listeners to update the game state and display the respective X or O symbol on the chosen cell. The game also includes functionality to prevent invalid moves, such as placing a symbol on an already occupied cell or continuing the game after a player has won.

To enhance the user experience, the project may incorporate additional features such as sound effects for player moves or game outcomes, highlighting the winning combination of cells, and an option to reset the game for a new round.

The project demonstrates the effective utilization of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a fully functional and enjoyable Tic Tac Toe game. It serves as an excellent learning resource for individuals looking to understand the basics of web development or gain hands-on experience in building interactive games using web technologies.

Whether you're a novice programmer or an experienced developer seeking inspiration, this Tic Tac Toe project offers an opportunity to explore the combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in action while revisiting the timeless game of Tic Tac Toe.
